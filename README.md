# VPPLocation v3.0.0b

VPPLocation Library for iOS simplifies the task of retrieving the user 
location and reverse geocoder info about it. 

In order to use it you should implement:
 
- VPPLocationControllerLocationDelegate to receive updates of the user
location.
- VPPLocationControllerGeocoderDelegate to receive updates of information
about user location, such as city name or address (`MKPlacemark` object).

Once implemented just add your class as delegate, using the methods 
addLocationDelegate: and addGeocoderDelegate:. Now your class will be 
happily working :)

Geocoding feature is adapted to both iOS 4 and 5. If device is running iOS 
4, MKReverseGeocoder class will be used. If device is running iOS 5, CLGeocoder
new class will be used. In any case the placemark object will be instance of
MKPlacemark.

This project contains a sample application using it. Just open the project in 
XCode, build it and run it.
