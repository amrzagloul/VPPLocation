# VPPLocation v2.0.0

VPPLocation Library for iOS simplifies the task of retrieving the user 
location and reverse geocoder info about it. 

In order to use it you should implement:
 
- VPPLocationControllerLocationDelegate to receive updates of the user
location.
- VPPLocationControllerGeocoderDelegate to receive updates of information
about user location, such as city name or address (`CLPlacemark` object).

Once implemented just add your class as delegate, using the methods 
addLocationDelegate: and addGeocoderDelegate:. Now your class will be 
happily working :)

This project contains a sample application using it. Just open the project in 
XCode, build it and run it.

**Important**: If you were using the previous version v1.0.0, you will have to
change all references to `MKPlacemark` objects with references to new 
`CLPlacemark` object. Anyway, they both share the same interface, so you just
have to change their class names.

## Changelog 
- 2012/02/08 (v2.0.0)
    - Removed all references to MKReverseGeocoder and MKPlacemark
and updated all code to use new CLGeocoder instead. This class 
appeared in iOS 5.
    - Also included a tiny CLPlacemark category to add a new property,
address, which will return a formatted address string.

- 2012/01/31 (v1.0.0): resumeUpdatingLocation will start the location manager if it hasn't been previously started.
